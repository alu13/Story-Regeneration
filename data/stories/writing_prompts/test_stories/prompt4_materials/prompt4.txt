The two knights stood opposite each other , on a hillock streaked with mist ; a golden haze in the early morning light . 

Beneath the haze , felled banners lay on dewy grass , dead hands holding them . There were so many -- the Red Horse of House Stayvrick , the Flayed Moon of the House Argold . The Dancing Nudes of House Gorstock , the Fluttering Wings of House Quicktreat . The flags of every major army in Ten Kingdoms , strewn amid rotting corpses . 

The knights were wading through the haze , gold fog coiling about their waists . One of them was limping ; a man in rusty steel , leaning on a halberd to hold him steady . 

The other man was fully armoured , in what looked like layers of onyx . He was eight feet tall with a body thick as an oak tree , and he held a broadsword in one hand . 

During the fray , nobody had been sure whose side the Black Warrior was on . He had simply turned up at the melee , swinging and hacking at anyone in his path . Looking for fame in battle , uncaring of where he found it . 

`` Wait , '' gasped Sir Gallant , the blue-eyed man . `` Just wait one second for me to catch my breath , would you ? '' 

Surprisingly , the Black Warrior did so . After all , they were the only two left standing . There was no harm in a short delay , for the sake of honour . 

`` Just one thing , '' Sir Gallant gasped , still leaning on his halberd ; swaying now , clearly in no shape to fight . `` Just one thing . '' He looked up at the Black Warrior , and smiled . 

`` I 'm Sir Argo Gallant , '' he said , `` the greatest warrior in the land . You 've heard of me ? '' 

Slowly , the Black Warrior nodded -- inclining his whole body to covey the gesture through his armour . 

`` You think you are a match for me ? You think you could defeat me at my best ? Come now , a fellow of your size must . '' 

Slowly , the Black Warrior nodded again . 

Sir Gallant took a straining breath , readying his strike . Abruptly , he let his halberd drop , and fell to his knees . His platemail clanked . 

`` Then really , '' he wheezed , `` would n't you rather battle on a day when I can stand ? Would n't the glory be tenfold ? '' 

The Black Warrior looked at the unarmed man , and said nothing . He held his sword steady for a moment . 

Then he turned , and began lurching toward the hilly horizon , away from the battlefield . 

Sir Gallant was left to wheeze and gasp , glad his strike had landed . A firm blow to the ego . Usually did the trick . 

Little did the Black Warrior know , Sir Gallant was not the greatest warrior in the land because he was the strongest , or the quickest , or the best equipped . 

Sir Gallant was the greatest because he always found a way to live .
