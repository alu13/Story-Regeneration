Darkness enveloped the desolate moor, the only sound the distant howls of the wind. Two knights, mere shadows in the blackness, stood opposite each other, shrouded in a fog that seemed to seep from the very earth beneath them. 

The field around them was littered with the remnants of a terrible battle. Fallen banners lay strewn amongst the rotting corpses, their once proud sigils barely visible beneath the grime and gore. The air was thick with the stench of death, and the mist seemed to writhe with the tormented souls of the fallen. 

The two knights, the last survivors of the carnage, stood facing each other, the fog swirling around them like tendrils of the damned. One was a haggard figure, barely able to stand, his rusted armor stained with blood. He leaned heavily upon a battered halberd, the last vestige of his strength. 

The other knight was a monstrous figure, clad in armor as black as the night around them. He stood taller than any man had a right to, his massive form like something from a nightmare. In one hand, he held a broadsword that seemed to absorb the darkness itself. 

During the battle, none had known whose side this Black Warrior had been on. He had appeared suddenly, a harbinger of doom, cutting down all who stood in his path. Rumors had whispered of a cursed being, a soulless monster seeking only to feed on the death and destruction of the battlefield. 

"Wait," gasped the haggard knight, his voice barely a whisper. "Let me speak before we continue this dance of death." 

To his surprise, the Black Warrior halted, his sword still dripping with blood. Perhaps even this cursed creature respected the final wishes of a dying man. 

The haggard knight looked up at the towering figure, his eyes filled with a desperate defiance. "I am Sir Argo Gallant," he said, his voice shaking. "You have heard of me?" 

The Black Warrior gave a slow nod, the motion somehow more terrifying than any sudden movement. 

"You think you are a match for me?" Sir Gallant continued, his voice growing stronger with each word. "You think you could defeat me at my best?" 

Once more, the Black Warrior nodded. But this time, his sword began to glow, the darkness around them bending and twisting as if drawn to the cold steel. 

Sir Gallant took a shuddering breath, readying himself for the end. He dropped his halberd, falling to his knees, and looked up at the towering figure. "Then perhaps," he whispered, "you would rather face me on a day when I am not already half-dead. Would not the victory be all the sweeter?" 

For a moment, the Black Warrior seemed to consider this. The darkness around them seemed to pause, waiting for his decision. 

But then, with a chilling laugh that echoed through the desolate moor, he swung his sword down, severing Sir Gallant's head from his body. The fog seemed to convulse in glee as the lifeless form slumped to the ground. 

The Black Warrior stood over his fallen foe, the darkness wrapping itself around him like a cloak. He had no need for the honor of men, nor the glory they sought. He was a creature of the shadows, and death was his only purpose. 

And so, the Black Warrior disappeared into the night, leaving behind only the corpses of the fallen and the howls of the wind.
