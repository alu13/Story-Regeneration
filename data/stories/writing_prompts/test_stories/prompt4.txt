**The Greatest Warrior** <newline> <newline> The two knights stood opposite each other , on a hillock streaked with mist ; a golden haze in the early morning light . <newline> <newline> Beneath the haze , felled banners lay on dewy grass , dead hands holding them . There were so many -- the Red Horse of House Stayvrick , the Flayed Moon of the House Argold . The Dancing Nudes of House Gorstock , the Fluttering Wings of House Quicktreat . The flags of every major army in Ten Kingdoms , strewn amid rotting corpses . <newline> <newline> The knights were wading through the haze , gold fog coiling about their waists . One of them was limping ; a man in rusty steel , leaning on a halberd to hold him steady . The visor of his helmet was up , to reveal a bruised and beaten face beneath . His blue eyes were the only feature visible amid the mud , blood and grime . <newline> <newline> The other man was fully armoured , in what looked like layers of onyx . His visor down , his face was a gleaming black space . He was eight feet tall with a body thick as an oak tree , and he held a broadsword in one hand . <newline> <newline> During the fray , nobody had been sure whose side the Black Warrior was on . He had simply turned up at the melee , swinging and hacking at anyone in his path . Looking for fame in battle , uncaring of where he found it . <newline> <newline> `` Wait , '' gasped Sir Gallant , the blue-eyed man . `` Just wait one second for me to catch my breath , would you ? '' <newline> <newline> Surprisingly , the Black Warrior did so . After all , they were the only two left standing . There was no harm in a short delay , for the sake of honour . <newline> <newline> Dark birds wheeled in the sky , impatient . They were waiting for the last spurts of movement to fade away , so their meal could begin . <newline> <newline> `` Just one thing , '' Sir Gallant gasped , still leaning on his halberd ; swaying now , clearly in no shape to fight . `` Just one thing . '' He looked up at the Black Warrior , and smiled . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm Sir Argo Gallant , '' he said , `` the greatest warrior in the land . You 've heard of me ? '' <newline> <newline> Slowly , the Black Warrior nodded -- inclining his whole body to covey the gesture through his armour . <newline> <newline> `` You think you are a match for me ? You think you could defeat me at my best ? Come now , a fellow of your size must . '' <newline> <newline> Slowly , the Black Warrior nodded again . <newline> <newline> Sir Gallant took a straining breath , readying his strike . Abruptly , he let his halberd drop , and fell to his knees . His platemail clanked . <newline> <newline> `` Then really , '' he wheezed , `` would n't you rather battle on a day when I can stand ? Would n't the glory be tenfold ? '' <newline> <newline> The Black Warrior looked at the unarmed man , and said nothing . He held his sword steady for a moment . <newline> <newline> Then he turned , and began lurching toward the hilly horizon , away from the battlefield . <newline> <newline> Sir Gallant was left to wheeze and gasp , glad his strike had landed . A firm blow to the ego . Usually did the trick . <newline> <newline> Little did the Black Warrior know , Sir Gallant was not the greatest warrior in the land because he was the strongest , or the quickest , or the best equipped . <newline> <newline> Sir Gallant was the greatest because he always found a way to live . <newline> <newline> While all the better fighters lay dead and gone around him , soon to be food for the birds .
