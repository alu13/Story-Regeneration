`` So basically , magic , '' said the bartender . The rest of the villagers murmured in agreement . 

I had stopped concealing my sighs hours ago . `` No . Elec-tri-city . '' 

The hardest part about suddenly appearing in the year 1612 is thinking you 're going to change the world and then realizing you have no idea how things really work . 

I had started with the whole bacteria thing and that went nowhere for awhile . I mean , think about it . Yeah , so there 's these tiny living things that are so small that you ca n't see them ( but trust me they 're there ! ) that are attacking your body , which by the way is made up of billions of tiny things themselves , and when the bad tiny things get the better of your good tiny things , you get sick , and your body has these specialized tiny things that fight the bad tiny things and if those fighting tiny things win , then you get better . 

Fuck me , right ? I had actually succeeded in introducing pasteurization . I did n't exactly know how to do that either , but I brought the pond water and milk to a boil before cooling it back down ( 'cause it kills the tiny bad things ! ) . The few people who looked passed my lunatic rantings and committed to trying my stuff were getting less sick from liquid , so I guess the process worked . I had a larger following now and they were listening to me . 

`` How about this , '' I said . `` So the lightning , that we create from ... uhm , this lightning creating station , travels through the metal wire that 's connected to every home , and is received by this glass ball that has this tiny piece of metal in it that glows from getting hot from the lightning and that 's electrical light for you . '' 

The villagers looked around at the candles and oil lanterns that lit the bar quite well , gave each other nods that seemed to say `` yeah we got this whole 'light ' thing down already , stop your lightning harnessing nonsense '' and turned back to me . 

`` So basically ... magic , '' said the bartender . 

`` Get me a key , '' I said over the ensuing rabble . `` And a kite . There 's a storm tonight and I 'll show you exactly what I mean . '' 

An old lady answered me . `` What 's a kite ? '' 

`` Get me some sticks and string and ... uhm ... paper ? Or cloth ? Uhm ... '' 

Fuck me , right ?
