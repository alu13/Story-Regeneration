"So, essentially, sorcery," muttered the bartender, the shadows in the room deepening as the villagers whispered and nodded in agreement.

I had stopped bothering to hide my exasperated sighs long ago. "No, elec-tri-city."

The most terrifying part about being abruptly transported to the year 1612 was believing you would change the course of history, only to realize you had no idea how things truly operated.

I began with the whole bacteria concept, but that led me down a dark and twisted path for a while. Consider it: Yes, there are these minuscule living things that are too tiny to see (but trust me, they're lurking there), that invade your body - which, by the way, consists of billions of minuscule creatures themselves - and when the evil little beings overwhelm your benevolent ones, you are consumed by sickness. Your body contains specialized tiny organisms that combat the wicked ones, and if those brave warriors prevail, you recover.

Damnation, right? Somehow, I managed to introduce pasteurization. I didn't exactly understand the process, but I boiled the pond water and milk before allowing it to cool (to vanquish the malevolent micro-beings!). The few villagers who looked past my deranged ramblings and dared to try my concoctions fell victim to fewer illnesses. My following grew, and they began to listen more intently to my words.

"How about this," I proposed, the sinister atmosphere growing heavier. "The lightning, which we summon from...uh, this lightning summoning station, travels through the metal wire connected to every home. It's received by this glass orb containing a minuscule piece of metal that glows with a hellish heat from the lightning's touch - and that's electrical light for you."

The villagers glanced around at the flickering candles and oil lanterns that cast eerie shadows across the room. They exchanged looks, seeming to say, "We've already conquered the darkness, cease your unholy lightning manipulation," and turned their attention back to me.

"So, basically... sorcery," repeated the bartender, his voice laced with fear and suspicion.

"Bring me a key," I demanded, as an ominous murmur rippled through the crowd. "And a kite. There's a storm brewing tonight, and I'll show you precisely what I mean."

An old woman's voice trembled as she asked, "What's a kite?"

"Fetch me some sticks and string, and...uhm...paper? Or cloth? Uhm..."

Damnation, right?
