"So basically, witchcraft," whispered the bartender, his voice barely audible over the murmuring of the villagers.

I had stopped concealing my sighs hours ago. "No. Elec-tri-city."

The hardest part about suddenly appearing in the year 1612 is thinking you're going to change the world and then realizing you have no idea how things really work.

My attempt to explain bacteria to them had been a disaster. I mean, think about it. Yeah, so there's these tiny living things that are so small that you can't see them (but trust me they're there!) that are attacking your body, which by the way is made up of billions of tiny things themselves, and when the bad tiny things get the better of your good tiny things, you get sick, and your body has these specialized tiny things that fight the bad tiny things and if those fighting tiny things win, then you get better.

Instead of being enlightened, the villagers had accused me of being in league with the devil. I had narrowly avoided being burned at the stake, but now I was their prisoner, locked in this tavern, surrounded by suspicious eyes.

"How about this," I said, desperate to prove my innocence. "So the lightning, that we create from... uhm, this lightning creating station, travels through the metal wire that's connected to every home, and is received by this glass ball that has this tiny piece of metal in it that glows from getting hot from the lightning and that's electrical light for you."

An old lady answered me. "What's a kite?"

"Get me some sticks and string and... uhm... paper? Or cloth? Uhm..."

The villagers exchanged glances; they had already made up their minds. They grabbed me, binding my hands behind my back, and led me out into the stormy night, the wind howling around us.

The old man from the corner, now revealed to be the village priest, raised his hands to the heavens. "If the lightning takes you, it will be a sign of your guilt. If you survive, we will accept your explanation."

As they tied me to a wooden stake, the key hanging from the branches above me, I stared up at the dark, swirling clouds and prayed that the ligh
