Completely shocked . I start moving as fast and quiet as I possibly can . Standing straight I 'm around 6 feet tall . So I remove his clothing and wear it myself . I grabbed the cling film and a pair of scissors from the kitchen and proceed to the garage . Take the gift wrap and some parachute cord from the garage and back to the living room . I ca n't hear anything upstairs . I wrap the body in cling film and mop up the blood of which there was very little . I had hit him over the head with a bat and he must have died instantly because his heart was n't pumping any blood onto the floor . I was able to clean it with the sleeve of his jacket . 

I wrap his body in cling film and thoroughly gift wrap it . His body is stiffening up nicely . I take my sons wakeboard and am rolling his fat ass outside to my truck . It 's just starting to light up and my neighbors do n't have lights on in their houses yet . To my amazement , there was a bright red sled and some reindeer outside . Of course ! I do n't have a chimney so they just parked in the front yard . Originally I was going to put him in the bed of my truck and secure the rope to where I could let go of the rope from the drivers seat and dispatch him on to a road somewhere that was n't busy . This is even better though . 

I tied one end of the chord to his feet and the other to the polished chrome trailer hitch on the back of his sled . I then punched Rudolph in the face so hard that he must of died but sure enough the rest started running away . The sled picked up speed and the lifeless body of of santa carving a path in the snow was rag dolling away . Unfortunately the gift wrap was ripped off in the process and his face was dragging along the concrete leaving a bloody skid mark on the road . Eventually they lifted off and were riding into the sunrise . The silhouette of the sleigh , body trailing behind , added a nice touch . As I was starting to go inside the reindeer lost control . Of course . I killed their navigator . They lost control and crashed into the neighbors house down the street and exploded . I didnt like john anyway . I 'm pretty sure my son is actually his . Admiring my handiwork , I turn around to see my family in the doorway , staring with open mouths . My wife feints . Fuck . Merry Christmas bitches .
