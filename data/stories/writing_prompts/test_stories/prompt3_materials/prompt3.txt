It was so easy to decide who my target was . 

It was even easier to do . 

The old coot had screwed me over before I was even born . Born a hemophiliac . Won the genetic lottery , with all my good fortune . The prize ? Factor VIII got to skip out on my body . 

A scrape could kill me . Almost had , a few times . All thwarted by cloth and a phone in her hands . 

I was sick of it all , having to watch out for every little thing that came near me , never having a pet , not being to take meds for the headaches . Not being able to play with friends because I was at the hospital every week . 

I could n't take it anymore , not when I learned she was going to remarry . 

She fell onto the floor , limp as a tissue . My first and only victim . 

I took a deep breath and laughed . My body felt light , and my head was clear . Things I did n't feel often . 

I had done it . 

I did the right thing . 

I did n't let her , in all her irresponsible desires , condemn another kid to a lifetime of pain and fear , a ticking clock that had to be wound back every day . 

The hammer clattered to the floor as it hit me . The knowledge swirled around my head , integrating with my self . 

Her pride as the young man graduated . Her sadness as doctors stuck a crying kid with needles . Her happiness as a calm boy slept , head in her lap . Her frustration as a toddler destroyed his room and again injured himself . 

Her curiosity as she approached the crying bundle in the trash . 

I fell to my knees , too light-headed to speak . I reached over and grasped my mother 's hand . 

I stayed for a while , blood congealing around me .
