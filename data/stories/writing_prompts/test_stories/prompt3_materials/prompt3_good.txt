It was a simple decision, really.

And even simpler to execute.

The old woman had sealed my fate before I had taken my first breath. Born a hemophiliac. A cruel twist of fate, a stroke of terrible luck. Factor VIII, the one thing my body needed, was absent.

A mere scratch could be the end of me. And it nearly was, on a few occasions. Only to be saved by cloth and a phone in her hands.

I grew weary of it all, of constantly being on edge, of never having a pet, of being unable to take medicine for the headaches. Of being deprived of playing with friends because I was a frequent visitor to the hospital.

The breaking point came when I discovered she planned to remarry.

She crumpled to the floor, as lifeless as a discarded tissue. My first and only victim.

A deep breath filled my lungs as I laughed. My body felt weightless, my mind clear - sensations I rarely experienced.

I had done it.

I had made the right choice.

I prevented her from subjecting another child to a life filled with pain and fear, a ceaseless countdown that needed to be reset daily.

The hammer fell from my grasp, the realization hitting me just as hard. The memories swirled around my mind, intertwining with my very being.

Her pride as the young man received his diploma. Her sorrow as doctors poked and prodded the tearful child. Her joy as the serene boy slept, head cradled in her lap. Her frustration as the toddler wreaked havoc on his room, injuring himself once more.

Her curiosity as she approached the wailing bundle abandoned in the trash.

I collapsed to my knees, unable to utter a word. I reached out, grasping my mother's hand.

And there I remained, as blood pooled around me.
