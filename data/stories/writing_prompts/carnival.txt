Carnival music seemed to dance in the background . A cacophony of color and knick knacks decorated the fairgrounds . It was just another day at the carnival . I sit at my stand reading another old junky sci-fi novel . <newline> <newline> “ So how much to see it ? ” <newline> <newline> Some pre-teen girl interrupted my book with her piercing voice . I sigh towards her and lean in . <newline> <newline> “ Ten dollars , just like the sign says. ” <newline> <newline> “ And it works ? ” <newline> <newline> “ So I ’ m told . ” <newline> <newline> “ You mean you ’ ve never looked ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nope , ” I say , picking my book back up . <newline> <newline> “ Well why not. ” <newline> <newline> “ Because some things in this life should be a mystery , ” I reply . <newline> <newline> “ Well I want to see , ” she says . I tap on the money box and she places her ten dollars in . I watch her go in and wait for the audible reaction . After a couple of seconds I can hear an excited squeal . She runs out jumping up and down . <newline> <newline> “ He ’ s so handsome ! ” <newline> <newline> I can see her run off in excitement . I smirk . Another idiot , I think to myself . The carnival director walks up shortly after . <newline> <newline> “ Time to start packing up , Isaac , ” he says . I nod and begin to break down my stand . <newline> <newline> My table is put away , and the money is locked up now . It ’ s that time again to put away the mirror . I stand in front of it like every other day . It ’ s just me , again . Same as yesterday , and the day before that , I am alone in the reflection . <newline> <newline> I smile at my reflection as I cover the mirror . I put the tent and everything in the back of my trailer with a skip in my step . <newline> <newline> You have to feel sorry for these suckers , I think . They ’ re destined for one person only . Who knows if they ’ ll ever find them ? At least I know where to always find myself .
