Carnival music seemed to dance in the background . A cacophony of color and knick knacks decorated the fairgrounds . It was just another day at the carnival . I sit at my stand reading another old junky sci-fi novel . 

“ So how much to see it ? ” 

Some pre-teen girl interrupted my book with her piercing voice . I sigh towards her and lean in . 

“ Ten dollars , just like the sign says. ” 

“ And it works ? ” 

“ So I ’ m told . ” 

“ You mean you ’ ve never looked ? ” 

“ Nope , ” I say , picking my book back up . 

“ Well why not. ” 

“ Because some things in this life should be a mystery , ” I reply . 

“ Well I want to see , ” she says . I tap on the money box and she places her ten dollars in . I watch her go in and wait for the audible reaction . After a couple of seconds I can hear an excited squeal . She runs out jumping up and down . 

“ He ’ s so handsome ! ” 

I can see her run off in excitement . I smirk . Another idiot , I think to myself . The carnival director walks up shortly after . 

“ Time to start packing up , Isaac , ” he says . I nod and begin to break down my stand . 

My table is put away , and the money is locked up now . It ’ s that time again to put away the mirror . I stand in front of it like every other day . It ’ s just me , again . Same as yesterday , and the day before that , I am alone in the reflection . 

I smile at my reflection as I cover the mirror . I put the tent and everything in the back of my trailer with a skip in my step . 

You have to feel sorry for these suckers , I think . They ’ re destined for one person only . Who knows if they ’ ll ever find them ? At least I know where to always find myself .
