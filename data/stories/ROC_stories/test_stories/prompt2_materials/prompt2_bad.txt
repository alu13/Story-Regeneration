Francis had always been haunted by the image of a faceless man in a suit, who would appear in his nightmares, choking him with a necktie. One day, he decided to confront his fear and learn how to tie a necktie himself.

At first, the task seemed daunting, and he fumbled with the knot, struggling to breathe as the tie constricted his neck. The image of the faceless man appeared before him, taunting him with each failed attempt.

But Francis was determined to conquer his fear. He practiced tirelessly, even as the faceless man continued to haunt his dreams, suffocating him with a necktie.

As the days went by, Francis's obsession with tying a necktie grew stronger, and he started neglecting everything else in his life. He stopped eating, stopped sleeping, and stopped going to work. All he could think about was tying the perfect knot.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Francis was able to tie a necktie perfectly. But as he admired his handiwork in the mirror, he saw the faceless man standing behind him, reaching out to strangle him with the very tie he had just mastered.

Francis's screams echoed through the empty room as the faceless man tightened his grip, slowly choking the life out of him. And in that moment, he realized that he should have never let his obsession get the best of him.
