Stacy initially planned on having five children. She and Bob joyfully welcomed a daughter into their family. Two years later, they were thrilled to have twin girls join their growing family. Now, Stacy is happily passing along her maternity and baby clothes to others in need, as she feels content with her beautiful family of three daughters.
