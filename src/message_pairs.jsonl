{"prompt": "Very productive. More productive than I used to be. I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I&apos;m particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don&apos;t become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you&apos;re not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you&apos;re good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you&apos;re finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It&apos;s an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven&apos;t done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ???***"}

From reading the bulletin boards at the student center, seeing the art outside and inside the galleries, and observing the way many students dressed, I felt that the Bard community isn’t afraid to step out of the box and push the boundaries on social norms. I also got the opportunity to talk to one of the students working at the admissions office. I remember that he had painted nails and I loved that, even as just a small thing, it pushed against what a lot of societies would deem unusual and even taboo. Talking to him, I got to learn more about Bard and its moderation process, which I see as just another way in which Bard is unique and pushes boundaries. I also see it as a way to really take in and review one&apos;s journey through college and look to the future journey. I guess that is the core of why I would like to attend Bard. I see the community as a group of people who are welcome to things that don’t exactly fit any social norm and a place welcome to reviewing oneself and making sure that the true self is showing.\n***"}

{"prompt": "I am a millionaire and I play around 3000 or more (just estimating) ranked games per year. I am still in Silver but if I am motivated I can get to plat before season ends. Most of the time I prefer to be in Silver because I like just relaxing with a league game and not having to plan stuff. When I play badly people usually say hey this guy won like 300 games and still in Silver. I know of students or working people that can&apos;t play this much and they seem to look down on me sometimes calling me basement dwellers. I get these people telling me to get a job and stuff. I find it irritating(cause they are toxic) and a bit funny. Sometimes people tell me to go refund skins or tell me to stop using mommy credit cards and I always use the same comeback, I am not poor. That shut them up real quick. Anyway I have many smurf accounts to play and each time i buy every single champ again and again. I usually do this to not get like &quot;300 wins and still in Silver&quot; comments and plus I was a toxic player (banned). It gets better now.
